Project Title: Weather Monitoring System

Objective: 
The goal of this project is to design a weather monitoring system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT11 sensor, and ThingSpeak to collect and store data on temperature and humidity levels. 
The system will allow the user to monitor weather conditions remotely and in real-time.

Components:
ESP32 microcontroller
DHT11 sensor
Jumper Wires
Breadboard
ThingSpeak Account

Functionality:
The DHT11 sensor will be used to measure the temperature and humidity levels. 
The data will be collected by the ESP32 microcontroller and transmitted to a ThingSpeak account, where it can be stored and displayed in real-time. 
The ESP32 will also be responsible for controlling the DHT11 sensor and transmitting the data to ThingSpeak.

Setup:
Connect the DHT11 sensor to the ESP32 board.
Connect the jumper wires to the appropriate pins on the ESP32 board and DHT11 sensor.
Create a ThingSpeak account and obtain an API key.
Upload the code to the ESP32 board.

Code:
The code for the weather monitoring system will be written in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using the ESP32 library. 
The code will use the DHT library to read the temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor. 
The data will be transmitted to ThingSpeak using the Wi-Fi capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller and the ThingSpeak API.

Conclusion:
The weather monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT11 sensor, and ThingSpeak is a simple yet effective solution for monitoring weather conditions. 
This system allows the user to collect and store data on temperature and humidity levels, and view the data in real-time from anywhere with an internet connection.
With its easy setup and customizable code, this system is a great choice for anyone looking to improve their weather monitoring capabilities. parameters over time, and more.
